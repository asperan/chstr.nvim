Chstr theme for Neovim.
===

Neovim theme based on [Chester theme from Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/colorschemes/c/index.html#chester).

This theme is created with [Lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).

## Notes
I mainly develop this theme for personal use. As such, I cannot test the theme for every existing plugin which defines custom highlight groups (obv, due to the lack of time and interest), but I'll gladly accept PR submissions.

Also, other than the basic groups, all the other groups will be set as I find them. If you find something before it has been defined, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
